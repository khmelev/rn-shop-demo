# React Native Demo Shop

This is an educational project. I'm just learning React Native and trying to create a hybrid (native + react native) demo app.

## How to build and run

1. Install all libraries
```sh
npm install
```
2. Build AAR with React Native code
```sh
npm run brownfield:android
```
3. Build native android app
- open `native-app/android` in Android Studio
- press green button "Run app"
